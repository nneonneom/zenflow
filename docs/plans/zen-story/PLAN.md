# Zenflow — Plan

## Vision

Zenflow eliminates the overhead that slows down the software development lifecycle. Developers, Product Owners, and Tech Leads spend too much time creating, coordinating, and tracking plans — writing epics, refining stories, documenting designs, chasing PR status — work that surrounds building software without being the building itself. Zenflow centralizes and automates that surrounding work: planning artifacts are generated and refined with minimal input, story state and dependencies are always visible, and the path from idea to merged code is shorter because the connective tissue between steps is handled, not managed.

## Capabilities

- User can create epics and stories in Jira
- User can create feature branches in GitHub
- User can send direct notifications via Microsoft Teams
- User can generate epic plans from provided requirements
- User can generate technical design documents
- User can generate architecture diagrams (C4, Sequence, Flowchart, State Machine)
- User can generate story implementation plans
- User can trigger an epic lifecycle workflow (epic planning → technical design → story breakdown and prioritization)
- User can trigger a story implementation workflow (start story → generate plan → approve/refine → create branch → implement → test → create PR → address PR comments)
- User can approve and refine generated artifacts at any workflow stage before progression
- User can hand off a workflow stage to another team member
- User can pause a workflow and resume it later from any machine (`zen-pause`, `zen-resume`)
- User can manually trigger a PR check on demand (`zen-pr-check`)
- User can register a background PR monitor that periodically checks active PRs (`zen-pr-monitor`)

## Out of Scope

- CI/CD pipeline management (Zenflow triggers workflows, does not own pipelines)
- Replacing Jira, GitHub, or Teams (Zenflow integrates with them, doesn't replicate them)
- Test infrastructure ownership (Zenflow invokes and updates tests; users own the test suite)
- UI/UX design or mockups *(potential future scope)*
- Sprint velocity, reporting, or analytics *(potential future scope)*
- Infrastructure or DevOps setup
- Time tracking or resource allocation
- VSCode extension or IDE plugin behavior (Zenflow is a Claude Code plugin)
- `zen-reset` — resetting workflow state *(deferred)*
- Teams Graph API / direct messages *(deferred — webhook vs Graph API TBD at implementation)*

## Module Map

| Module | Owns | Does NOT own |
|---|---|---|
| **Commands / Workflows** | Slash commands, skill entry points, multi-step orchestration, stage transitions, handoff logic, approval/refinement prompts | Artifact generation, external API calls |
| **Planning Core** | Generation of plans, technical designs, diagrams, and story implementation plans | Workflow state, external services, user interaction |
| **State Store** | Reading/writing workflow state to the `zenflow-state` orphan branch on the working repo, organized in `{story-id}/` subfolders — `state.json`, `plan.md`, `status.md`, and `slices/` per story | Business logic, artifact generation, orchestration |
| **issue-tracker-adapter** | All Jira operations via `jira-cli` (primary) + Jira REST API (fallback) — fetch stories, move to In Progress | GitHub, Teams, workflow state, artifact generation |
| **repo-adapter** | All GitHub operations — feature branches, PRs, PR comment handling, `zenflow-state` branch reads/writes | Jira, Teams, workflow logic, artifact generation |
| **notifier-adapter** | All Teams operations — notifications, approval messages (implementation TBD: webhook or Graph API) | Jira, GitHub, workflow state, artifact generation |
| **PR Monitor** | Scheduled cron trigger, polling active PRs via State Store, detecting review comments and approvals, invoking `zen-story` on events, sending Teams notifications on approval | Workflow orchestration, artifact generation, PR operations beyond status checks |

**API credentials** live in `~/.claude/settings.json` env section — not a module.

## Core Journey — Story Implementation Workflow

1. Developer runs `zen-story` with optional story ID
2. `zen-story` calls `story-start` — fetches story from Jira via `jira-cli` (or prompts user to select from assigned non-closed stories), moves story to In Progress, initializes `{story-id}/state.json` on the `zenflow-state` orphan branch of the working repo
3. `zen-story` calls `story-plan` — Planning Core generates a sliced implementation plan: asks clarifying questions if needed, confirms target PR branch (default: main), breaks work into ordered implementation slices, presents full plan for user approval
4. User approves plan — `plan.md` (full plan with slice backlog), `status.md` (current slice tracker), `slices/` (per-slice detail), and updated `state.json` (with `current_slice: 1`) committed to state branch
5. `zen-story` creates feature branch `zenflow/{story-id}-{concise-description}` via `gh` CLI
6. `zen-story` calls `story-implement` — executes the current slice from `status.md`, updates `state.json` and `status.md` on completion, notifies developer via Teams if input needed mid-implementation; repeats until all slices complete
7. Quality checks and test suite run
8. `zen-story` calls `story-create-pr` — Planning Core generates PR description from plan and story context, `gh` CLI opens PR to target branch, PR URL written to `state.json`
9. `zen-story` hands off to PR Monitor and exits
10. PR Monitor wakes periodically:
    - Review comments detected → invokes `zen-story` with PR event + workflow state → `zen-story` calls `story-implement` to address comments, pushes commits (PR auto-updates)
    - PR approved → sends Teams notification to developer, marks workflow state complete in `state.json`

**Pause/Resume:**
- `zen-pause` — writes current stage to `state.json` on state branch, exits cleanly
- `zen-resume {story-id}` — fetches state branch, reads `state.json`, re-invokes `zen-story` from last saved stage
- `zen-story {story-id}` on existing state — prompts: "State found — run `zen-resume` to continue or `zen-reset` to start fresh"

| `zen-story` | `story-plan` | story context from State Store |
| `zen-story` | `repo-adapter` | create feature branch |

| `story-start` | `issue-tracker-adapter` | story ID or assigned story fetch |
| `story-start` | State Store | initialize story state |
| `story-plan` | Planning Core | story context + clarifying Q&A → sliced plan |
| `story-plan` | State Store | write `plan.md`, `status.md`, `slices/`, updated `state.json` (`current_slice: 1`) |

| `story-implement` | `notifier-adapter` | mid-implementation notifications |
| `story-create-pr` | Planning Core | generate PR description |
| `story-create-pr` | `repo-adapter` | open PR, write PR URL to state |

| PR Monitor | `repo-adapter` | fetch PR status and comments |
| PR Monitor | `zen-story` | PR event + workflow state |
| PR Monitor | `notifier-adapter` | approval notification |
| PR Monitor | State Store | mark workflow complete |

**Notes:**
- Stage commands are pure leaves — they never call each other
- `zen-story` is the only orchestrator of stage commands
- `repo-adapter` owns all GitHub operations including `zenflow-state` branch reads/writes
- API credentials stored in `~/.claude/settings.json` env section
- `jira-cli` is primary for issue-tracker-adapter operations, REST API is fallback
